# Analysing Covid-19 Geospatial Data with Python
In this project, I have processed the geospatial data using Python. I have went through different geoprocessing tasks including how to create Geodataframes from CSV files, visualize the data, and perform spatial join.
## I will walk through the following:
* Introduction
* Reading Data
* Geodataframe with Geopandas
* Base Maps
* Bubble Maps
* Spatial Join
* Choropleth Map
